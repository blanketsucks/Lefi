# Tokens
In all of the examples shown, I have used `os.getenv("DISCORD_TOKEN")`.
You will want to replace this with your token or set an ENV var or alternatively-
set a `.env` file and use `python-dotenv`.

# NOTE
`example_voice.py` Uses youtube_dl, which breaks Youtube's ToS and can break copyright laws.
This is strictly added here as an example for voice impl; I am not responsible for any actions that you may be taken against you for misuse.
